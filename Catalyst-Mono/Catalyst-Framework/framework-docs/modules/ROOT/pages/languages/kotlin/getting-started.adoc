== Choosing the Web Flavor

Spring Framework comes with two different web stacks: xref:web/webmvc.adoc#mvc[Spring MVC] and
xref:testing/unit.adoc#mock-objects-web-reactive[Spring WebFlux].

Spring WebFlux is recommended if you want to create applications that will deal with latency,
long-lived connections or streaming scenarios.

For other use cases, especially if you are using blocking technologies such as JPA, Spring
MVC is the recommended choice.
